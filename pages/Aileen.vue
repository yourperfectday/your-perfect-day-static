    <p>
      An IIOC (Irish Institute of Celebrants) qualified celebrant, I am an experienced public speaker and
      writer. I would describe myself as warm and professional (with a healthy dose of Irish humour!).
    </p>
    <p>
      I will work with you to create and deliver your perfect ceremony. My goal is to provide you with a
      ceremony that reflects your love, values and your two individual personalities. Or, in the case of
      baby naming ceremonies, the personality of your new little person! And I will deliver that ceremony
      with solemnity, joy and a touch of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I look forward to giving you your perfect day.
