      A lasting love is one of the best reasons for celebration!
    </p>
    <p>
      Your marriage is a story shared by so many people who have been touched by your shared life. More
      and more people across Ireland are choosing to mark their relationship’s endurance and evolving nature
      by coming together with friends and family to renew the vows they made to each other.

    <p>
      Your vow renewal ceremony can take any tone that you want – Aileen will work with you to create a
      fitting tribute to your years together and the ones yet to come. Whether you are looking for a non-
      religious or multi-faith ceremony, it will be carried out to the highest standards with warm
      professionalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our vow renewal ceremonies normally include your story as a married couple, blessings (such as hand-
      fasting or candle lighting), readings and the renewal of your vows (which can include the addition of new
      vows to reflect your marriage’s current chapter). However, this can easily be changed to suit each
      couple. Aileen will work with you both to create your a ceremony that fits you both perfectly.
